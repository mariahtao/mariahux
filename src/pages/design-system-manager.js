          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <h3>Problem statement</h3>
          <p>
            The software needed to scale aggressively to keep up with the
            growing user base. There wasn't a cohesive UI and the design system
            was one page in Figma with only a few basic components and only one
            product out of many used the design system. There were major pain
            points in the software from poor UI to usability issues.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            Scale the design system to support all the products the company
            offers and create a great experience for the designer and builders
            creating the products.{" "}

                  I implemented accessibility standards (WCAG AA) into the
                  design system to ensure all of our products followed
                  accessibility standards from its core.

                <li class="start">
                  In Figma, I utilized the variants feature to help scale and
                  build components. This helped to define the use cases for
                  different components and speed up prototyping when designing.

          <h3>Color</h3>
          <p>
            Created standard system colors and decorative colors using radial

          <h3>Text</h3>
          <p>
            Set a base font size as Body/Regular and created other body and
            heading sizes around the base multiplied by rems.

          <h3>Shadows</h3>
          <p>
            Created shadows for various use cases such as dark, light, focus,

          <h3>Style sheet</h3>
          <p>
            Create CSS variables from the defined styles to use in our frontend
            framework.

              I took the design system from 1 page to 41 pages to accommodate
              all products and features
            </li>
            <li class="default">
              The design system now includes all UI components for every product
              external and internal, design tokens, and hundreds of frames of
              documentation (refactoring, schemas, dependencies)

            <li class="default">
              Previously, only 3 people in the company looked at Storybook to
              view the design system including myself
            </li>
            <li class="default">
              Currently, over 50% of the company looks at Storybook to not only
              view the design system, but also demo the product updates and find
              documentation

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Design systems benefit the team building the product just as much as
            the users using the product. A good design system functions as the
            source of truth for the engineering and UX of the product. It
            improves the designer and developer experience as well as
            on-boarding for new team members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consistency and standards is included in Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 general
            principles for interaction design. A design system is one way to
            maintain consistency and improve the user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, I learned to always have the data and research to
            effectively advocate for UX best practices.{" "}
